## Stack

- Go - programming language, also referrred to as golang
- Gorilla Mux - HTTP routing and URL matcher
- JWT - JSON web tokens for authentication & authorization
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/) - Golang object-relational mapper layer (facilitates changing datastore)
- Postgres - relational datastore for production
- SQLite3 - relational datastore for development
- MinGW (optional) - gcc for Windows (needed for SQLite3 on Windows)

## Prerequisites

- Install golang, postgresql, and mingw (for SQLite3)

```Powershell
choco install golang -y
choco install postgresql -y
choco install mingw -y
```

Default $GOPATH is C:\Go.

Optional: Periodically run `choco upgrade all -y` to keep packages current.

## Common Go Commands

```
go                     // list options
go version
go help
go fmt
go mod tidy             // clean up unneeded dependencies
go get -u -t ./...      // update all versions
go get "html/template"  // get a specific package
```

## Initialize Project (go mod init)

From within this project folder assign a globally unique name to your project 
(use your username and repo name in the command below):

```Powershell
go mod init github.com/denisecase/go-hunt-sql
```

This will create an editiable go.mod file (lists dependencies like package.json) 
and a autogenerated go.sum file (lists checksums) 
in the root folder of the project repo. 

## Build Project

```Powershell
gofmt -s -w .
go build
```

## Run Project (Includes Build)

```Powershell
go run app.go
```

If it asks about running autofix, select Y.

If Windows asks about allowing access, click Private / unclick Public.
